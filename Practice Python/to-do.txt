Here are some beginner to intermediate-level Python projects to help you regain your skills:
1. Basic Projects:

    Calculator App: Build a simple command-line calculator for basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).

    To-Do List Application: Create a text-based to-do list where users can add, remove, and view tasks.
    
    Guess the Number: A game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number within a specific range.
    
    Unit Converter: Build a program that converts units (e.g., Celsius to Fahrenheit, kilometers to miles).

2. File Handling Projects:

    File Organizer: Create a script to automatically sort and organize files in a folder based on their extensions (e.g., images, documents).
    
    Password Generator: Build a password generator that creates strong random passwords.
    
    Log Parser: Write a program to read log files (like .txt or .csv) and extract meaningful information (e.g., errors, specific user data).

3. Web Scraping Projects:

    Web Scraper: Scrape a website (e.g., IMDB or Wikipedia) to gather information like movie ratings, descriptions, or trending topics.
    Stock Price Tracker: Build a program that scrapes stock price data and tracks changes over time.

4. Data-Related Projects:

    Weather App: Use an API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to fetch current weather data for different cities.
    Movie Recommendation System: Use a dataset (like IMDB movies) and simple algorithms to recommend movies based on user input.
    Basic Data Analysis: Use a dataset from Kaggle (e.g., Titanic dataset) and analyze it using pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib.

5. Game Projects:

    Tic-Tac-Toe: Create a command-line version of Tic-Tac-Toe that allows two players to play.
    Hangman: Develop a command-line Hangman game where the player guesses letters to form a word.

6. API Projects:

    Currency Converter: Use a currency conversion API to convert one currency to another in real-time.
    Movie Information API: Build a program that uses an API (like the OMDB API) to get information about movies based on user input.

7. Intermediate Projects:

    Chatbot: Create a simple chatbot using basic logic to respond to user input.
    Flask Web App: Build a small web app using Flask (e.g., a basic blog site or personal portfolio).
    Expense Tracker: Develop an expense tracker that allows users to input daily expenses and get a summary at the end of the month.

8. Automation Projects:

    Email Automation: Write a program that sends scheduled emails using Python’s smtplib.
    Bulk Image Resizer: Create a script that resizes all images in a folder to a specific resolution.
    PDF Merger: Automate merging multiple PDF files into one using Python’s PyPDF2 library.

These projects will not only refresh your Python skills but also give you real-world practice.
